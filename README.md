# Hi, I'm Aman Choudhary ðŸ‘‹

A Data & Business Analyst who genuinely enjoys solving real-world problems using data.

Iâ€™m someone who likes clarity â€” whether itâ€™s in making decisions, communicating with people, or building solutions. Thatâ€™s exactly what pulled me towards Analytics.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked with organizations across industries helping them automate manual processes, build dashboards that actually make sense, optimize workflows, and most importantly â€” enable smarter, faster decisions backed by data.

## My Education:
- Masters of Science in Business Analytics - Texas A&M University with a GPA of 3.5 
- Bachelors in Urban and Regional Planning - Amity University with a GPA of 3.6

## What I Do Best:
â†’ Automate processes that waste time  
â†’ Build dashboards that are not just pretty, but actually useful  
â†’ Create SQL queries that simplify complex datasets  
â†’ Translate messy business problems into clean data-driven solutions  
â†’ Help teams see their numbers, trends, and stories clearly  

### Tools I Work With:
SQL | Python | Tableau | Power BI | Salesforce | Excel | Snowflake | ETL | SSMS | SSIS

But more than tools â€” I care about *why* we are building something and *how* it helps the business.

## About Me (beyond work)
If thereâ€™s one thing that defines me â€” itâ€™s adaptability. Iâ€™m like water â€” I adjust, I learn, and I take shape of whatever challenge comes my way.

Outside work, Iâ€™m someone who loves:
- Cricket & Volleyball
- Exploring offbeat places
- Adventure trips over city life
- Aviation Enthusiast
- Photography (mostly unplanned shots)
- Learning anything new â€” from data to stock markets to random life skills  
- Part time DJ 

I naturally enjoy conversations that go beyond small talk â€” especially when thereâ€™s a common interest involved.
